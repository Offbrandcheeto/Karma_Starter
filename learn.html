        <p class="text">
          First off, I want to cover a couple of basic principles before you
          began. The first is not to get frustrated if this doesn't work
          overnight. Keep at it, and it will pay off. Second, quality will
          always trump quantity. Third, never repost or spam on Reddit
          communities. That will get you banned quickly. And my final essential
          tip is to enjoy the little wins. Don't get caught up in your long-term
          karma goal. Take it day by day, and it will take care of itself. So
          let's get you out of the starting hole and take your karma to the
          moon!

          you how to gain karma with memes even on a day one account!
