          Memes are one of the main attractions of Reddit, and there are
          colossal meme communities with millions of users. But those require a
          lot of karma and post karma. So these communities will come later down
          the road. But even when you just join Reddit, there's a great meme
          community you can post in! r/Memes_Of_The_Dank is a meme community
          with 700k+ users, and you can post in it on day one. With their top
          posts getting thousands of upvotes! This makes it the perfect meme
          community for you to begin your journey. This could instantly catapult
          your karma and get you into the prominent communities in one go! So
          now that we have the community taken care of let's learn how to make a
          great meme!
        </p>
        <p class="text left">
          The primary source of my 100k+ karma has been memes, and over the past
          year, I've grown quite good at making them. And there is no one secret
          to making a great meme, but I'll share with you some of my crucial
          pointers for making the next viral Reddit meme. The first is by far
          the most important, quality. The quality and look of your meme must be
          good. The image and text must be tremendous and clean-looking. The
          second tip is to find something that people can relate to. You can't
          make a meme about something only a small group of people know about.
          So make your ideas broad and appealing. The third tip is to have a
          great Reddit title and meme title. These will describe your meme and
          give people the context they need to understand the meme. Make sure
          these titles are short, funny, and descriptive of your meme. And the
          final tip is to be original. Don't try and copy a meme you've already
          seen. This will not do well with people and can even get you banned
          from communities. So now that you have a great community to post in
          and a basic understanding of making a solid meme let's look at the
          final step. Making your meme!
        </p>
        <p class="text left">
          Now when making your meme, I strongly suggest using your smartphone
          and using an app called Mematic. Mematic will be your primary meme
          maker and is an excellent app for doing so. I've made all of my memes
          with Mematic, and they've all looked amazing. Mematic allows you to
          upload your images and meme templates while also providing tons of
          already made templates. At first, I recommend using already created
          templates and taking a shot at that first. This will be a process, and
          this is something I can't teach you. Instead, you have to explore what
          works and doesn't work when it comes to your memes. Try different
          things on Mematic and learn for your winners and your failures. And if
          you do so, karma will follow!
