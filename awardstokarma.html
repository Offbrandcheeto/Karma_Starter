          Another fantastic way to gain some karma quickly is by giving and
          receiving Reddit awards. Reddit awards are little items you can give
          to a post that you really like. And when you do this, you get some
          awarder karma, and the recipient receives awardee karma, a win-win for
          both of you. So how do you get awards? So awards will cost you coins,
          and if you buy them just to get the karma there not a good investment.
          Coins will cost you real money and can be pretty expensive. But, there
          is a way to get free awards! Every couple of days, Reddit gives you a
          free award to give to another person's post. This is an easy way to
          get some free awarder karma and make another person's day.
        </p>

          So when it comes to getting awards on your posts from people, there's
          no exact way to do that. Making a great post and having it get into
          the top posts in a subreddit is about the only way. The more people
          that see the post and think that it's funny, the better. This will
          increase the chances that someone will give you an award, which will
          provide you with a solid chunk of awardee karma.
