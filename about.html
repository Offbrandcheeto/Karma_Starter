          My name is Parker Glas, and my Reddit username is Offbrandcheeto14.
          I've been using Reddit since March 2020, and it's grown to be one of
          my favorite places to spend time. But just like you, at the start, it
          wasn't so great. I couldn't post in most communities, and I barely had
          any karma. So I researched and spent tons of time to try and climb out
          of starting hole. And after tons of work and time, I finally did. And
          now I have over 115k+ karma and 400+ followers in just around a year
          and a half. But, I don't want you to do all the work I did. So I made
          this site to help you get out of the starting hole and be able to use
          the site freely. So let's get started!
