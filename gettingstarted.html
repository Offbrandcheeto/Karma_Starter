          When first getting started on Reddit, it can be tough to find good
          communities to post on. But, it's not impossible. Let's begin with two
          self-explanatory and quite useful ones. r/FreeKarma4U and
          r/FreeKarma4You. These are solid places to start getting some karma at
          the start of your journey. They're both full of users going through
          the starting struggle and understand what everyone's going through. So
          all you do is simply make a post asking for karma in those
          communities, and people will upvote and comment on your post. In most
          cases, people will ask for an upvote on their posts or comments, and
          they will upvote yours. So you pat their back, and they pat yours.
          Entirely new users can also use these communities. So you can use
          these right out of the gate.
        </p>
        <p class="text left">
          Another great way to get some karma right out of the gate is comments.
          Even when you start on Reddit, you can still comment on most
          communities. This can be a great way to get a lot of karma quickly. A
          good strategy for this is to go to the rising posts section of a big
          community. Then find a post that you like and make a funny or
          informative comment. When you do this in the rising posts, your
          comment will still be near the top of the post, and if the post makes
          it too hot, you'll have tons of people looking at your comment. This
          could amount to some serious karma if done correctly. Also, just
          commenting on posts, in general, can be an excellent starting way to
          get some karma!
        </p>

          So now you should have some basic ideas and tools to start getting
          some of that sweet karma. These are a couple of great ways to start,
          and we'll continue to build off them in the future. So now it's your
          turn to get out there and start building up your karma!
